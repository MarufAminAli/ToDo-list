# ToDo-list
ToDo list made with ejs, css, javascript, node, express, mongodb and mongoose
I have used ejs for templating multiple lists with different names, used node with express to use express routing for different lists for eg if u go to localhost:3000/work , localhost:3000/school or any list you want just type in localhost:3000/<your choice of list name here> you will find a seperate list for it made on the go for you and all of it is stored in a database on your computer using mongodb and mongoose 
you will need to have mongodb installed and run the command mongod in ur terminal in order for the web application to create a new databse called todolistDB

download/clone into ur pc then open directory in terminal and type "node app.js" then go to browser and then go to localhost:3000 to see the todo list.
if you have nodemon then type "nodemon app.js".
